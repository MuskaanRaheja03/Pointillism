Pointillism is the name of a painting technique where patterns of
coloured dots are used to form the coloured regions of an image. For
this assignment, you will practice with looping control structures to
create a program that can read in a source image and create a
larger 'new' version of that image (i.e., scaled up by an integer
value) using a pointillist style. Your program will visit each pixel in
the source image and then draw several coloured shapes on the
larger image at corresponding (but slightly randomized) positions.
To clarify, detecting a magenta pixel in the very top left corner of
your source image should result in you using several red and blue shapes in the top left area of your
result (although the precise approach for accomplishing this are left for you to investigate yourself).
In order to complete this task, you will need to:
• read about the pointillism painting technique online
• decide on a scaling factor between 4 and 8 that you will use to find the 'new' image dimensions
• decide whether to use circles, squares, or rectangles as the 'points' to be drawn (using pygame)
Your submission for this assignment:
• must be a source code file with filename 'comp1405_f22_#########_assignment_05.py'
• must NOT import anything other than the pygame, random, and sys libraries
• must get the name of the source image as a command-line argument
• must use nested loops to visit each pixel of the source image and get its colour value
• must use one or more loops to draw an appropriate1 number of 'points' in your 'new' image
• must randomly alter the position of the drawn 'points' in your 'new' image2
• must NOT use colours for drawing 'points' other than red, green, blue and (if you wish) black3
• can assume that the user will always provide the name of a valid image when prompted
